# Machine Learning Journey
Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey repository! This repository is a collection of machine learning algorithms, neural network models, and other related projects that I am learning and implementing. As I progress in my understanding and skills, I will continually update this repository with new code, examples, and insights.

This repository documents my personal journey through the world of machine learning and neural networks. As I learn new concepts and techniques, I will implement them and share my code here. This repository serves as both a learning log and a resource for others who might be on a similar path.
## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories, which will be populated as I learn and implement new topics:

* Algorithms: Contains implementations of classic machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, etc.
* Neural Networks: Includes various neural network architectures such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
